## Requirements

DotNet Core 3.1 and any supported IDE for DEV running.

## About

This is the replacement for the Find EPAO capability of the current Find Apprenticeship Training Service. Find EPAO is now it's own service. It provides users with a way to find an EPAO for a particular course.

## Local running

You are able to run the website by doing the following:
* Run the console app ```SFA.DAS.FindEpao.MockServer``` - this will create a mock server on http://localhost:5003
* Start the web solution ```SFA.DAS.FindEpao.Web```
